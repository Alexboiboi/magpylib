discussion -----------------------------------------

naming: 
.rotate_from_angax()


2do-------------------------------------------------
- test Cylinder numerical instabilities
- move edgecase Box to field_BH_Box
- provide output for mag=000 #practical when sweeping through 0
- make a cuboid edgecase within 1e-14
- profile getB()
- complete tests
- __init__ docstrings providing brief overviews
- find a mag=(mx,my,mz) tooltip solution
- check_dupicates might destroy col.sources order
- add remaining sources
	sphere
	currents
	dipole moment
	facet
- bring edgesize in context with magnetsize
.magnet
- Box()
- Cylinder()
- Sphere()

.current
- Line()
- Circular()

.moment
- Dipole
- FEM
- Virtual


mid term improvements ------------------------------

- add new sources
    - virtual field
    - cone
    - arc
    - tile

- complete type hints
- adress field_BH_Box edge/corner stability problem
- throw errors instead of warning+sys.exit()

- bringing getBv functionality to getB
	getB(*sources, **kwargs
	# M sources
    kwargs= {
		pos_obs = []   		# N1 x N2 x ... x 3
		src_pos = []   		# M x O1 x O2 x ... x 3
		src_rot = []		# M x O1 x O2 x ... x 3
		dim = []			# M x P x dim
		mag = []			# M x P x mag
		niter = 50
		}

- finally adding sensors and sensor paths to getBv

- potential performance increase:
    Can we speed up the computation by combining similar
    pos/dim combinations but different mag, avoiding
    full computation but just perform scalar mult.

    For cuboids this is the same idea as construction
    of the demag tensor.

    its even possible to throw in the scaling property

- Cuboid field performance:
    Distinguish if 1-2 or 3 non-zero magnetizations
    and compute as different instances. This should give
    a speedup of a factor 2 or 3 in most cases !

- Speedup elliptic integrals by complementing cel with
    special cases K and E faster algorithms

- getF
- FEM source
- finite sized currents
- optional input type checking



DO NOT DO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

class BaseSource
	- getB
	- getH

WHY? : This would improve the copy-paste docstring problem, 
	but not allow direct hints what inputs are needed
	in the src.getB() code inspection. For each source
	they can be quite different.


class BaseGeo
	- __add__

WHY? : We dont want __add__ because a sensor inherits BaseGeo
    but it should not be addable to Collections
