2do----------------------------------
move edgecase Box to field_BH_Box
provide output for mag=000 #practical when sweeping through 0


potential improvements------------------------------

potential performance increase:
    Can we speed up the computation by combining similar
    pos/dim combinations but different mag, avoiding
    full computation but just perform scalar mult.

    For cuboids this is the same idea as construction
    of the demag tensor.

    its even possible to throw in the scaling property

Cuboid field performance:
    Distinguish if 1-2 or 3 non-zero magnetizations
    and compute as different instances. This should give
    a speedup of a factor 2 or 3 in most cases !
