The analytical solutions
########################

Magnetic field computations in Magpylib are based on known analytical solutions (formulas) to permanent magnet and current problems that can be found in the literature. For magpylib we have used the following references:

* Field of cuboid magnets: [1999Johansen, 2013Camacho]
* Field of cylindrical magnets: [1994Furlani, 2009Derby]
* Field of facet bodies: [2009Janssen, 2013Rubeck]
* all others simply derived by hand

Subsequently we show a short reflection on how these formulas are achieved. The magnet solutions are mostly derived via the magnetic scalar potential. In magnetostatics (no currents) the magnetic field becomes conservative (Maxwell: :math:`\nabla \times {\bf H} = 0`) and can thus be expressed through the magnetic scalar potential :math:`\Phi_m`:

.. math::

    {\bf H} = -\nabla\cdot\Phi_m

The solution to this equation can be expressed by an integral over the magnetization distribution :math:`{\bf M}` as

.. math::

    \Phi_m({\bf r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{V'}\frac{\nabla'\cdot {\bf M}}{|{\bf r}-{\bf r}'|}dV'+\frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{S'}\frac{{\bf n}'\cdot {\bf M}}{|{\bf r}-{\bf r}'|}dS'

where :math:`{\bf r}` denotes the position, :math:`V` is the magnetized volume with surface :math:`S` and normal vector :math:`{\bf n}` onto the surface. This solution is derived in detail e.g. in [1999Jackson].

The current solutions are directly derived using the law of Biot-Savart:

.. math::

    {\bf B}({\bf r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int_{V'} {\bf J}({\bf r}')\times \frac{{\bf r}-{\bf r}'}{|{\bf r}-{\bf r}'|^3} dV'

In some special cases (simple shapes and homogeneous magnetizations and current distributions) these integrals can be worked out directly to give analytical formulas (or simple, fast converging series). The derivations can be found in the respective references.
