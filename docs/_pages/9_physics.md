# [WIP] Physics & Computation

## The analytical solutions

Details about how they are set up
Formulas and expressions used in magpylib, references to literature

### Hard and soft magnetic materials
We cannot do soft, theres a lot of reasons we we dont need to

### Demagnetization
Solution accuracy, analytical modeling of demagnetization and interaction

### Limits and Convergence


### Convergence of diametral Cylinder
No. iterations

### Computation

SIMD

vectorized code

performance tests

parallelization
